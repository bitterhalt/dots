## My dots to sway
This config to my keyboard driven system. My point was to get light weigth system without useless annoyances, so this may not be your thing, if you are fan of flashy animations like hyprland has. Also there is no install script and things are bit messy, so I wouldn't recommend cloning my entire setup, but instead to try copying bits and pieces as you put together your own dotfiles unique to you.
