## My dots
List of configs to my keyboard-driven system. My point was to get light weight system without useless annoyances.

There are no install scripts and things are bit messy, so I wouldn't recommend cloning my entire setup, but instead to try copying bits and pieces as you put together your own dotfiles unique to you.
